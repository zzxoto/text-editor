>>Virtual DOM is the Datastructure that represents the structure of our DOM.
>>Virutal DOM has a reference to the head of linked list.
>>Every node in the linekd list represents a line
>>A line is an array of characters
>>To add a new line any where, add a node in the respective index
-------------------------------

Things that will be difficult to imitate.
>> CTRL + Z --> To imitate undo feature, I have to somehow keep track of 'snapshot' of my virtualDOM. I am thinking of, stacking informations like {line: 20, char: 'a'},
   instead of actually making seperate copy of virtualDOM on every changes, such that I could reverse the change based on information.
>> Bulk copy and bulk delete --> It will create chaos into my neat 20 line segment block structure. So, many edge cases.
-------------------------------

Side Notes:
	>>It started off as some doodling in Jquery then, MVC kind of pattern began to emerge, then translating VirtualDOM into actual DOM would have been so messy had it not been for React.
	>>Probably wil get rid of Jquery entirely in future.
	>>Backspace and bulkInsert logic have been implemented in earlier commit.
